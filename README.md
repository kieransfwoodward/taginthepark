**Tag in the Park: Paving the Way for Proximity-Based AI Pervasive Games**

In this article we introduce “Tag in the Park,” a mobile platform merging short-range wireless communication and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create an interactive gamified experience through virtual treasure hunts. Central to this is a mobile app that revolves around the interaction with a network of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Near Field Communication (NFC) tags. These miniature smart devices provide contextual information, AI challenges, quizzes and nudges for a gamified, and active visitor experience which can help increase engagement and promote physical activity. “Tag in The Park” is currently available for download on both Google Play and Apple Store and the platform is fully set up and open to visitors at Rufford Abbey Park, Nottinghamshire. Results indicate the mobile platform helps engage visitors, encourages exploration and increases visitor economy.
