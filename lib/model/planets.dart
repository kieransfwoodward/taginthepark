The Rufford Abbey estate once had not one but three sets of grand gates: The Eastern, Northern and Western Gates. Only the Western Gates still survive. They’re a familiar landmark for motorists travelling on the A614.    The first image in the gallery is a modern view looking out of the park towards “West Lodge” – built around 1840. Now it’s a private house, but once a Gatekeeper lived there, controlling who was allowed into the Abbey grounds.     Take a closer look at those heraldic finials (fancy tops) of the Western Gates.     The coat of arms - with its two parrots and nesting pelican - are those of John Lumley Savile, the 8th Earl of Scarborough, who had these fine gates built, around 1841.",

You can still see the pool running underneath the modern floor. No water flows through today, sadly.   In the 1700s, cold water bathing was a new craze. It was thought to be good for your health! Later, in Victorian times, a glass roof was added (swipe gallery left). The Bathhouse became The Orangery – a conservatory full of ornamental plants.  Outside the Orangery is a stone fountain called the Nemi Fountain. It was modelled on a Roman oil lamp found by Lord John Savile in one of his archaeological digs in Italy. Swipe the gallery at the top left again to see how it looked when it still pumped water.",

    description: "The building where today’s visitors enjoy coffee and snacks once had a very different use. In the days when Rufford Abbey was a grand country house, horse drawn vehicles were stored here. Lord Savile kept a number of smart carriages to take him and his family on visits and excursions. These were drawn by matched carriage horses. The coach went out it was attended by uniformed coachmen and outriders. Small carts for workaday purposes such as carrying servants or luggage, were kept here too, and even the Abbey’s own fire engine! An 1856, inventory of the Coach House listed:‘... 3 Dog Carts, 1 Light Cart, 1 Fire Engine, 3 Phaetons, 1 Brougham, 1 Omnibus, 1 Britzka, and 1 Brake.’ By 1906, the list included not only an elegant Landau (open horse drawn carriage) but now for the first time a ‘horseless carriage’ - a Daimler limousine. Lord Savile, like his friend King Edward VII was a ‘petrol head’ in an age when motor cars were toys of the rich only. He even had a couple of early steam powered cars!  The Charioteer of Delphi (on the other side of the bricked archway) is a famous bronze statue from ancient Greece. The figure inspired this modern sculpture. The fluted column-like base suggests the flowing robe worn by the original charioteer. William Pye, born in London in 1938, is a sculptor who works in stainless steel and cast bronze.",

    description: "Grooms, whose job it was to tend the horses and make sure they were smartly turned out, lived on the top floor of the buildings. Stable lads mucked out the stalls, and fetched feed and water. Captain Henry Savile, who owned Rufford Abbey in Victorian times brought in an architect called John Birch to remodel the stables. The cast iron dragon water hoppers at the top of the drainpipes, and the dragon finials on the roof date were added. Look at the picture in Mr Birch’s book. Can you spot what never got built? Captain Henry bred racehorses. One - Cremorne - was buried in the Abbey’s Pet Cemetery. His racehorses were not kept in the Rufford Stables, but at Rufford Stud Farm, a short walk away across the fields (now a private home.) Today the Stables house a Gift shop and Deli. In days gone by this courtyard was a busy workplace. The Stables housed the carriage horses needed to pull Lord Savile’s coaches, and also the riding horses used by family and guests. The large clay vessel at the entrance to the Stable Courtyard was made in three sections finished using coiling. Its colours were inspired by the Australian landscape and Aboriginal art. Robin Welch is a well known contemporary British potter. He was born 1936. Robin designed for several commercial pottery companies, including Wedgwood and Denby.",

Does it remind you of a seed pod, pine cone or nut?  Verbascum by Pauline Monkcom Carved from terracotta blocks. Verbascum (White Mullein) would have been grown by the monks in the original herb garden at Rufford Abbey. Its flowers were used as a remedy for coughs and catarrh, and its dried stalks as lamp wicks. Pauline was born in London but grew up in the Caribbean. During her career, she spent some years as a gardener. ",

Our English lime trees have nothing to do with the tropical limes that produce the tangy green fruit we see in supermarkets! In the 18th century having a Lime Tree Avenue on your estate was fashionable. We think the limes were planted about 1840. Before that beech and elm trees surrounded the Abbey front. Here’s a description from a Victorian travel book: An immense edifice of not very recent date, erected upon, and engrafted into, the remains of the ancient monastic building. Its situation is extremely sequestered, and the entrance front is so completely embowered in a grove of elm and beech. During World War II, there were Nissan huts on the lawn (to your right as you head away from the Abbey.) These housed Italian prisoners of war. They were used by the Forestry Commission as late as 1960. ",

      description: "From this viewpoint in the Formal Gardens you will be able to see several sculptures:  The Oil Patch Warrior by Jay O’ Meilia  Created in 1991, this bronze statue originally stood in Duke’s Wood near Eakring. It commemorates the site of secret WWII oil wells, drilled by American oil workers to assist Britain’s war effort. A matching statue cast from the same mould stands in Oklahoma, USA, to symbolise the collaboration between the two nations. Born in Oklahoma in 1927, the artist served as a navy artist in World War Two. His work has been shown in galleries worldwide.  The Fruit Gatherers by Peter Randall Page . This group was inspired by a photograph taken by Edward Curtis depicting three Saguro women carrying baskets on their heads. Visitors sometimes affectionately call it “The Mushroom Ladies!”The sculptor was involved in the design of the Education Centre at the Eden Project. The forms in his work are inspired by the geometry to be found everywhere in nature. Now, can you name three fruits beginning with the letter A? The Shrine at Nemi by Peter Lewis This installation was commissioned to celebrate Sir John Savile – Victorian owner of Rufford Abbey – who was a keen amateur archaeologist. In 1885 he funded an excavation at Nemi in Italy– an ancient Roman lakeside shrine to the goddess Diana. Many artifacts from Nemi made their way to Nottingham Castle Museum. The sculpture incorporates motifs from the Nemi nds. Peter Lewis is a researcher and lecturer in Creative Technologies at the University of Bolton. His many public commissions include an installation at the Imperial War Museum.",

Here’s how the kitchens in the 1930s after the Abbey had been stripped of its furnishings and the Abbey was waiting to be sold. This kitchen produced meals for all the house servants, and the Savile family when they were in residence. Here are some of the foodstuffs bought for Rufford Abbey in 1657, listed in a book of household accounts. Heron, goose, seagull, wild goose, moor pullet, rook, shell fowl, sparrow, swan, peacock, thrush, turkey, geese, partridge, woodcock, capons, pullets, lark, pheasant and teal.

The one you see today was added to the house by a Victorian architect, Salvin, in the Elizabethan style that was all the rage then. Note those twisty columns -'Solomanaic' columns to use their proper name. They must have been re-used after Salvin’s makeover in the 1840s. Swipe the gallery above to see how the West front looked in the 1900s. The Savile’s sold Rufford Abbey 38 years later and left the house. But by 1965 a partial demolition had been carried out. The whole ‘North Wing’ (on the left of the 1900 photo) had disappeared (swipe the gallery left). Most of the Abbey had to be demolished because of dry rot, mining subsidence and lack of maintenance in the years during which it stood unoccupied.",

This is all that is left of the medieval monastery of Rufford Abbey.Walk into the Frater and look down towards the waxwork of the praying monk. This room dates back to 1147 A.D.  The Frater was originally the dining room of the ‘Lay Brothers’ – those monks who worked out in the fields to support the monastery, as opposed to Choir Monks who spent most of their day in prayer.  A reconstruction of a monks’ dining table shows you the simple fare the Lay Brothers ate.  After the monastery closed and the monks left, a grand country house grew up around the remains of the old abbey. We think that for many years the Undercroft was filled with rubble and spoil, and not cleared out again until Victorian times. The image above shows how the Frater looked around 1900, when it was the Servant’s Dining Hall.

For example; the addition of the bath house, the creation of the lake and mill buildings, the construction of the brewhouse, water tower and coach house and also the addition of five ice houses. Although Rufford Abbey once boasted five ice houses, only two remain today. All were constructed around 1820, when the estate was owned by John Lumley-Savile, 8th Earl of Scarbrough (1788–1856). The five ice houses are located near Rufford lake, created c. 1750; for the simple reason that the movement of ice from its source was easier.Not all of Rufford's ice houses faced north, as accessibility and the logistics of the ice may have meant that the builders found it easier to place the doorways facing the lake rather than northerly. It is believed that ice was mainly taken from Blackwalk Pond, which was drained to make way for housing in the 20th century. Blackwalk Pond was used to serve the abbey in Rufford's monastic era, and later supplied water to Rufford's water tower and brewhouse, which remain on site today. ",
